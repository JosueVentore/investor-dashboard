# Ventore Investor Dashboard

Insight-first portfolio dashboard for Ventore.

## Requirements
- **Node.js 20** (recommended: `20.x`)

### Quick start
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## What this is (and is not)
✅ A decision-ready dashboard (KPI + insights)  
✅ Multi-project portfolio view (projects stay distinct)  
✅ Governance / compliance visibility  

❌ Not a spreadsheet  
❌ Not a raw data dump  

## Project rules (critical)
The following are **distinct projects** and must remain distinct everywhere:
- **ARIA (Stage 1)**
- **ARIA (Stage 2)**
- **POLARITY**
- **RUNE**
- **NOUR**
- **FIRA**

Notes:
- An investor can be in multiple projects (comma-separated list in the source data).
- ARIA Stage 1 and Stage 2 are treated as separate projects.
